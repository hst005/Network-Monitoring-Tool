	<h4><u>Introduction</h4></u>
	<p>Network monitoring for a network is a critical IT function that can save money in network performance, employee productivity and
infrastructure cost overruns. Network monitoring can be achieved using various software tools or a combination of plug-and-play hardware and
software appliance solutions. A network monitoring tool monitors an internal network for problems. It can find and help resolve snail-paced
webpage downloads, lost-in-space e-mail, questionable user activity and file delivery caused by overloaded, crashed servers, dicey network
connections or other devices.<br>
When failures, unacceptably slow response or other unexpected behavior is detected these tools send messages to designate locations to
notify system administrators, thus providing more operational visibility.Virtually any kind of network can be monitored. It doesn’t matter
whether it’s wireless or wired, a corporate LAN, VPN (Virtual Private Network) or service provider WAN. We can monitor devices on different
operating systems with a multitude of functions, ranging from servers,routers and switches to cell-phones. The Network Monitoring Tool that I have designed is a simple but a very effective tool. Different monitoring tools are designed using different architectures.

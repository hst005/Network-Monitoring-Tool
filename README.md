# Network-Monitoring-Tool
The objective of this project is to develop a network monitoring tool.This Network Monitoring Tool essentially detects abnormal behavior of any host and in case of such abnormality checks for its activities by decrypting data (packets) sent across the network by this host machine. Thus, by reading this packet information we can analyze the nature of its conversation. Then we can take necessary action against that host in order to make it function properly. Network Monitoring Tool (NMT) works with the help of tcpdump. tcpdump can be used to capture some or all packets received by a network interface. The range of packets captured can be specified by the using a combination of logical operators and parameters such as source and destination Mac or IP addresses, protocol types (IP and Ethernet) and TCP/UDP port numbers.

The login credentials will be managed by you using phpmyadmin , whatever table you may create you can login accordingly
then it will redirect you to redirect.php ,finally giving the required result
